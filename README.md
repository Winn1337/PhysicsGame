# "Physics Game" (WIP)
This game is currently in production! I plan on releasing it on Itch when I'm happy with it :)

## Uni project
This game started as a project in a game physics course. The minimum requirements for the project were the following:
- A basic game loop
    - A start line and a finish line.
    - Elapsed time etc is displayed when the race is over.
    - Ability to start over.
- A vehicle with,
    - A body, wheels (two or more) and wheel suspensions.
    - A basic model of an engine, where braking and accelerating torques are applied to the wheels based on user input and input duration. When the player holds down an acceleration button, for example, it should take a while before the maximum accelerating torque is reached.
- A game camera that follows the vehicle.
- Track segments with a variety of slopes, ramps, pits etc.
- Basic graphics with textures or solid colors.
- Some form of collectible, e.g. coins.
- A simple GUI that displays elapsed time and the number of obtained collectibles.
- User input from the keyboard or a controller.
